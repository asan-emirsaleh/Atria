# Atria

## Install from source

**Caution**: The Atria GitHub repository contains the source code of benchmark toolkit, but does *NOT* contain the *source code and build script* of trimming program. If you need Atria trimming program, please download the binary release [here](https://github.com/cihga39871/Atria/releases).

Atria is written in [Julia Language](https://julialang.org/) v1.4. Julia version < 1.3.1 is not supported.

### OSX

#### Prerequisite

OSX 10.8 or higher, 64-bit system.

Please download Julia using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), and then you can access to `julia` in terminal without other settings.

After you have Homebrew installed, in your terminal, run

```bash
brew cask install julia
```

> Or download a 64-bit `Julia-<version>.dmg` file from <https://julialang.org/downloads/>, but you need to add `julia` to your PATH manually.

Then, download `pigz` (a compression/decompression software used in Atria).

```bash
brew install pigz
```

#### Atria

Download the Atria git repository:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/cihga39871/atria.git
```

Go to `atria` directory, and read the help page of `build_atria.bash`: (do not use `build_windows.jl`.)

```bash
cd atria
bash build_atria.bash
```

After installation, Atria is available at `./app-*/bin/atria`.

#### Prerequisite

Linux, 64-bit system.

Please download Julia v1.4.2 from the [website](https://julialang.org/downloads/oldreleases/), and symlink `julia` binary file to your PATH.


Then, download `pigz` (a compression/decompression software used in Atria).

If you use Ubuntu, try `sudo apt install pigz`. You can also download it from [pigz's official site](https://zlib.net/pigz/).
